# Laboratory work Nr.1

Task
===

Searching for tourists, expertly.
Finally, your dream came true and you've landed a job at
"HeinleinAI" { the biggest AI company in the whole Luna-City! You're on a testing period
so you will want to make sure that you do your best. While you are daydreaming about free
lunch, the mentor comes and hands you your rst task { you'll need to build an expert system.
They say that while going through the central library database they stumbled upon this ancient
approach that looked like it could solve a particular lunar problem { detecting tourists. The
tourists on Luna-City are a big source of income and while almost every salesman and hotel
administrator can easily tell one from a Loonie, our mentor researches a more systematic way
of detecting them. While this would prove a trivial task to the city's main computer, resources
are scarce these days and so you will be researching alternative, more special approaches. For
starters, research the types of tourists that visit Luna-City and collect a database of at least
5 tourist types and the criteria by which they can be distinguished from Loonies and between
themselves (i.e. clothes, accent, gait, height and opinion on politics). After your database is
done, create a system that would allow the user to answer some questions about a possible
tourist. If the set of given answers matches a type of tourist from the database, this should be
the system's answer. If on the other hand, the system determines that the person in question is
a Loonie, the answer should be returned accordingly. Make sure to consider the case when the
set of answers does not nd a match in the database (highly improbable if you've done your
research well). Another thing to consider is how the system will be deployed. The machines
that are at your disposal are only capable of running Python code or Docker images. So if
you choose to write your system in something exotic, like Prolog, make sure to package it all
accordingly. To aid you in your task, the mentor gave you some ancient "lab" document and
some Python code that he found in the library. Who knows how that might help..


Find an example implementation of an expert system and execute it on your computer. Answer
the following questions:

**1. What is an Expert System?**

Expert System is an interactive and reliable computer-based decision-making system which uses both facts and heuristics to solve complex decision-making problems. 
It is considered at the highest level of human intelligence and expertise. The purpose of an expert system is to solve the most complex issues in a specific domain.

The Expert System in AI can resolve many issues which generally would require a human expert. 
It is based on knowledge acquired from an expert. Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems are capable of expressing and reasoning about some domain of knowledge. 
Expert systems were the predecessor of the current day artificial intelligence, deep learning and machine learning systems.

**2.What process does an Expert System try to mimic?**

Well-designed systems mimic the reasoning process that experts use to solve specific problems. 
Actually expert system attempt to mimic human experts. In other word, expert system is a set of software that can be used for decision making to the 
level of an expert, or even beyond, in specific field to solve problems.


Expert Systems are programs that mimic the behavior of an expert human in a particular field. 
This program uses the information that user stored in them to express an opinion on a particular topic. 
Thus, expert systems until they find something that matches your answers continue to ask from you.


Expert system as a subset of artificial intelligence is trying to mimic human behavior and emulate 
in solving the problems and the solutions. (Arab Mazar Yazdi & Soleimani & Khaksari, 2010)

**3.What is the role of a human expert in an Expert System?**

The expert transfers knowledge to the expert system. Since the basis for creating an expert system is the knowledge of real experts in various fields. 
When a large ES is created, the knowledge base and examination process is usually designed by the knowledge engineer from the facts and rules provided by the expert.

**4.What are examples of Expert Systems in use today?**


MYCIN: It was based on backward chaining and could identify various bacteria that could cause acute infections. It could also recommend drugs based on the patient's weight. It is one of the best Expert System Example.

•	DENDRAL: Expert system used for chemical analysis to predict molecular structure.

•	PXDES: An Example of Expert System used to predict the degree and type of lung cancer.

•	CaDet: One of the best Expert System Example that can identify cancer at early stages.

•	ACE: The expert system identifies malfunctions in the telephone network and gives recommendations on the necessary repairs and restoration measures. 
It is developed by Bell Laboratories.

•	DXplain: This is also a clinical support system that is capable of suggesting a variety of diseases based on just the findings of the doctor.
